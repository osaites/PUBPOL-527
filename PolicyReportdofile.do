**METHODS:
*Using data from the 2019 American Community Survey (ACS), we will examine the use of social safety
*net programs in relation to educational attainment for observations in the state of Washington. We will
*filter by age, limiting our responses to those who are over 25 so that we are not using cases of children
*and young adults who have yet to have the opportunity to receive a higher education. We will use
*Medicaid coverage and food stamps as indicators of reliance on the social safety net. We will further
*analyze how education affects these variables within different subgroups based on race and metropolitan
*status.

**----------------filtering observations to WA, older than 25------**
tab statefip
tab statefip, nol

**statefip for WA is 53

**generate a variable for adults in the US and WA over 21

gen usadults =.
replace usadults = 1 if age > 21   

gen wadults =. 
replace wadults = 0 if usa == 1
replace wadults = 1 if statefip == 53 & age > 21


**--------------Generating Higher Education Variable---------------**

tab educd
tab educd, nol

*81 is Associate's degree and 101, 114, 115, and 116 are all 4-year degree or above
* can consider this as having received a higher education

gen higherassociate =.
replace highera = 1 if educd > 80
replace highera = 0 if educd < 80
label define highera 0 "No Degree" 1 "Degree"
label value highera highera
tab highera if wa==1
tab highera if usa==1

**-------------Metro Area-------------**

tab metro
tab metro, nol
replace metro =. if metro == 0


*create binary for ttests later
gen metrobinary = 1 if metro >= 2
replace metrobinary = 0 if metro == 1
label define metrob 0 "Not in Metropolitan Area" 1 "In Metropolitan Area"
label value metrob metrob

gen seattle =.
replace seattle = 1 if wa == 1 & city == 6430
replace seattle = 0 if wa == 1 & city != 6430

**----------Race-------------**

* use binary of racwht
tab racwht


**-------------Food Stamps-------------**
tab foods
*alter to 0 and 1 in order for means to be proportions/probabilities
replace foods = 0 if foods == 1 
replace foods = 1 if foods == 2
label define foods 0 "Not a recipient" 1 "Food stamp recipient"
label value foods foods

tab foods if usa==1
tab foods if wa ==1


**-------------Medicaid----------------**
tab hinscaid
replace hinscaid = 0 if hinscaid == 1 
replace hinscaid = 1 if hinscaid == 2
label define hinscaid 0 "Not Covered by Medicaid" 1 "Covered by Medicaid"
label value hinscaid hinscaid

tab hinscaid if usa ==1
tab hinscaid if wa ==1


**-------------Initial ttests----------**

ttest foods, by(highera)
ttest hinscaid, by(highera)

**food stamps ttests for WA adults**
ttest foods if wa == 1, by(highera)
ttest foods if wa == 1, by(racwht)
ttest foods if wa == 1, by(metrob)
ttest foods if wa == 1, by(seattle)

**for US adults
ttest foods if usa == 1, by(highera)
ttest foods if usa == 1, by(racwht)
ttest foods if usa == 1, by(metrob)

**Medicaid ttests for WA adults**

ttest hinscaid if wa == 1, by(highera)
ttest hinscaid if wa == 1, by(racwht)
ttest hinscaid if wa == 1, by(metrob)
ttest hinscaid if wa == 1, by(seattle)

**for US adults
ttest hinscaid if usa == 1, by(highera)
ttest hinscaid if usa == 1, by(racwht)
ttest hinscaid if usa == 1, by(metrob)

**Graph

graph bar foods, over(highera) over(racwht)
